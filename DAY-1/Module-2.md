# Day 1 - Module 2: Machine Learning Key Takeaways

## 1. What is Machine Learning (ML)?
A subfield of AI where machines learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

## 2. Supervised Learning
- Learning from labeled datasets.
- Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.
- Applications: Spam detection, Image classification.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Learning by interacting with the environment.
- Concepts: Agent, Environment, Actions, Rewards.
- Exploration vs. Exploitation.
- Applications: Game playing agents, Autonomous vehicles.
